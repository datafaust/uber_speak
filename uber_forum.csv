"numbakrunch","Uber LoversI just wanted to give you some feedback on my new Geico Rideshare policy that I purchased a few weeks back I recommend you read your personal insurance documents for your policy before you make any decisions and before you contact your insurance company to ask questionsI speak for myself as other may disagree but my Geico personal auto policy will not cover me if Im running the app or have passengers in my car with the purpose of ridesharing In fact I should look forward to being cancelled for using my policy for other reasons not covered under my auto policyI finally decided the risk was not worth the reward which as of late has been terribleFor this example lets say I own a late model Toyota I was paying about 650 per year with low deductibles for both comp and collision coverage and driving about 12K miles per year Coverage levels were above VA minimums so I was paying a little extra to begin with  Too many high end cars in this area to be running state minimumsNow with the same vehicle I am going to pay 1600 per year with an estimated usage of 25K miles per year with the same collision deductible and a slightly increase on the comp side So I am basically paying about 80 more per month or 20 a week and I dont have to worry about anything Worth it I personally think soWhile the increase appears to be a lot this is better than having to worry about not being covered or worse getting cancelledNow you say that Uber and Lyft provides insurance They sure do with the following deductiblesUbers 1000Lyfts 2500Keep in mind that you must report the accident to your insurance company first this assumes you were at fault your personal insurance will deny the claim and you will be provided with a nice cancellation letter to take effect in the near futureSo Im paying 1000 more a year but If I have an accident Im already on the hook with Ubers deductible The risk of not being covered and getting cancelled is not worth it I should also mention that I have multiple cars on my personal policy not for rideshare use and a teenage driver too So to me its not worth the risk of getting cancelled BTW when you look at your policy it runs for 6 months and the commercial policy runs for an entire year One of my passengers was telling me a story about Geico wanting to cancel his policy because he son was using his car to deliver pizzas So you see if youre using your car for other reasons besides personal youre running a major risk You can lie about it if you want but its just not worth it Insurance companies are here to make money so

Commission had a meeting and a stopgap solution was for the suburban resident to register the cab in his home state the DCTC would issue a temporary DCTC card to allow him to work in the City   The Hack Inspectors and the Chief of the Office of Taxicabs complained that this would be an enforcement nightmare as it would encourage even more illegals to come into the City  More than a few of the suburban residents did actually take the stopgap measure  Finally after a few telephone calls eMails and meetings it was agreed that DC could register the cabs belonging to the suburban resident owneroperators and charge them an extra fee   Some of those who had Virginia and Maryland plates did get back their DC Hplates but not all  It got to the point where there were about twelve left who had suburban plates on their DC cabs  Finally the DCTC told those twelve that they had to stop using their suburban registered vehicles  Sadly for them the DCTC had stopped issuing Hplates and would not issue new Hplates to those twelveThere was a time when it was easy to register your car in a jurisdiction in which you did not live  Various states started to put an end to that in the mid1980s  By 1992 with the Federal rules taking effect for one drivers licence almost every state had shut off the practice  Virginia would be the easiest although an insurer there might require me to produce a

"Another Uber Driver","According to the law in both Maryland and Virginia these cab drivers are supposed to carry local registrations as well  For a brief period Virginia did not permit dual registration for certain classes of vehicles including taxicabs   Maryland does not enforce that rule except in individual cases where you get a police with a fly up his noseAs to Virginia I am more than well aware of what happened as several of the drivers there asked me to help the deal with it   First you will be aware of the County Decal business  The suburban an d exurban counties have no problem issuing a decal to vehicles carrying out of state plates  Recently Arlington and Farifax passed ordinances requiring that vehicles parked on public streets for more than a  certain period of time carry Virginia registration or in the case of nonresidents military government corporate assignment students a reciprocity sticker  As these cab drivers are residents they could not get a reciprocity sticker  They hired a lawyer and tried to go both to Richmond and the local government to get an exemption  One kept sending them back to the other neither would help them   Finally Richmond told them simply to buy the Virginia plates and pay the Uninsured Motorist Fee   As you are no doubt aware you can get Virginia plates without insurance you must pay a fee however to get them   These drivers were trying to avoid that or having to carry two policies  As taxicablimousine insurance  is a nich market in Washington none of the insurers there are admitted in Virginia  Richmond was willing to accept the DC insurance just the same but in DC the minimums are lower  Richmond did tell the drivers that if they could get their limits up to Virginia standards they would accept the nonadmitted policy  DC cab drivers can not purchase higher limits or other protections some of us want to do that but can not  Thus the drivers were frustrated again   As Arlington and Fairfax are enforcing these laws viciously the drivers had to pay up  Those who have garages have manged to duck this but even those who park in a driveway have not managed to do soAs for the commercial vehicles in the residential neighbourhoods you might recall that you have driven by townhouse developments or in some cases condominiumapartment complexes and seen a long line of DC taxicabs parked on the main road  This is because the covenants on the deeds in the townhouse developmentscondominiums or the Homeowners Association Rules have banned the parking of commercial vehicles  For the apartments the landlord will not park commercial vehicles on his lots  For many years some cab drivers used magnetic top lights against the DC rules and had magnetic panels painted in the same color as the cab  When they went home they could remove the top light and place the panels over the lettering  This allowed them to duck the Commercial Vehicle definition in the covenantsRules as those rules usually defined a commercial vehicle as something with lettering  The Hplate alone did not bring the vehicle into the definition of commercial vehicleNow that the Taxicab Commission has mandated these Let Us Get More Cab Drivers Robbed and Killed lights and required a seal on them they want to make sure that more of us get robbed or killed the driver can not remove the light   He can still buy panels to cover the

so much and we are so happy to have you as an Uber partnerBestBradleyFollowed my emailHi BradleyI would be grateful if you could clear up a couple of things You say that there is a 15 million policy however the email I got from Jerome said it was only 1 million Which is it Which ever it is I cannot get a copy of the policy to produce if asked The ecopy on the Waybill does not count as I have been told by a police officer that a printed document would be required and Uber is unwilling to provide such a document I have asked before Upon reading the exclusions in my personal policy it is quite clearly stated that using my vehicle for commercial purposes especially carrying passengers who are paying for it is excluded This umbrella policy only kicks in if my personal policy will not pay any claims So it is not primary  I would have to report any incidentaccident to my personal policy which I already know that they will not pay Most if not all personal auto insurance policies are likely to cancel the coverage if you make such a claim If I did decide to get For Hire plates your coverage would not not be enough to qualify me I would have to get my own commercial insurance in my nameHaving spoken to a NC Insurance Broker I have been told that claiming on my personal policy would not only be cause for them to cancel my personal policy but also to put my name on a national register as having committed fraud and I probably would become uninsurableThere are too many conflicting statements from Uber for me to be confident of driving as fully covered for and all incidents Paying the higher premium for commercial insurance would ensure that I would not be able to make a profit as an Independent Contractor and the margins are already such that I am currently driving for minimum wage or lessUnder such circumstances I could no longer drive for Uber legally and there are thousands of other Uber drivers out there that are just unaware of the precarious position they are
